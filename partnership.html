        <h2>Biodegradable Materials (Polylactic Acid)</h2>
        <p><strong>Supplier:</strong> Ichiplas<br>
        <strong>Why them:</strong> Based in Johor Bahru, Ichiplas is an expert in plastic injection moulding with three factories in Malaysia. They specifically list “Sustainable Solutions” and “eco-friendly materials” as part of their services, and their “Future Focus” is “Committed to supporting sustainable and green products”.</p> 
        <p>These are bioplastics made from renewable resources like corn starch, not from fossil fuels. They are designed to be composted, meaning they can break down into natural components like water and CO₂ under the right conditions. Using this for the gripper's body directly applies the Material Selection Tools concept by choosing a sustainable, non-toxic material with a responsible end-of-life plan.</p>

        <h2>Rechargeable Batteries (Nickel-Metal Hydride AAA)</h2>
        <p><strong>Supplier:</strong> GP Batteries (Malaysia)<br>
        <strong>Why them:</strong> A major global brand with a presence in Malaysia. They offer a wide range of Recyko rechargeable batteries and are a strong option for both quality and potentially easier local logistics.</p>
        <p>These are AA or AAA batteries that can be charged and used hundreds of times. Instead of a linear "use-and-dispose" model, they are kept in a loop, which drastically reduces hazardous waste and conserves resources. This is a perfect example of applying Circular Economy Tools by prioritizing reuse and eliminating the waste of single-use batteries.</p>
